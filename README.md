# Off_board_EV_charger_MATLAB
This project focuses on implementing DQ-based control and fuzzy logic control techniques for a bidirectional off-board electric vehicle (EV) charger. The objective is to minimize Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and stabilize system voltage and current, ensuring efficient and reliable charging performance.
