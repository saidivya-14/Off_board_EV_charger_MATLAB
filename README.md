# 🚗🔋 Optimized Control of Bidirectional Off-Board EV Battery Charger

## 📖 Project Overview
This project implements a **DQ-based control system** combined with **fuzzy logic control** for a **bidirectional off-board electric vehicle (EV) battery charger**.  
The main goal is to **reduce Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)** and **stabilize voltage and current** during the charging and discharging processes, improving the efficiency and reliability of the EV charging system.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Minimize THD in the input current.
- Stabilize output voltage and current.
- Implement DQ control to manage real and reactive power.
- Integrate fuzzy logic control for enhanced system response and stability.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- MATLAB/Simulink (for modeling and simulation)
- Control System Design (DQ transformation, PI controllers)
- Fuzzy Logic Toolbox (for fuzzy control implementation)
- Power Electronics Concepts (Bidirectional converters)

---

## 📈 Results
- Significant reduction in input current THD.
- Improved dynamic response with fuzzy logic control.
- Stabilized output voltage during both charging and discharging modes.
